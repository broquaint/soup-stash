# About

This site exists due the largesse of the operators of the [cao][],
[cdo][], [cszo][] and [clan][] servers so a big thanks to them first of
all!

It serves to allow players to see any game of
[DCSS][cdo] that has been played and hopefully in
the future provide more aggregate data e.g statistics, graphs,
accomplishments, etc.

Currently it contains all the games for versions 0.11, 0.12 & trunk
played on all of those servers based on the logfiles. It also watches
the logfiles so keeps apace with the latest games.

This site is still in *alpha* mode so please excuse the rough edges
and the general lack of completeness.

The owner and operator is [broquaint](mailto:broquaint@broquaint.com)
(aka [Snowclone][myplayer]) and the source code can be found at
the [soup-stash github repo][repo].

# About

This site exists due the largesse of the operators of the `cszo` and
`cdo` servers so a big thanks to them first of all.

It serves to allow players to see any game of
[DCSS](http://crawl.develz.org/) that has been played and hopefully in
the future provide more aggregate data e.g statistics, graphs,
accomplishments, etc.

Currently it contains all the games for version 0.11 played on either
of those servers based on the logfiles. It also watches the logfiles
so keeps apace with the latest games.

This site is still in *ALPHA* mode so please excuse the rough edges
and the general lack of completeness.

The owner and operator is [broquaint](mailto:broquaint@broquaint.com)
and the source code can be found at
[the github repo](http://github.com/broquaint/soup-stash).
